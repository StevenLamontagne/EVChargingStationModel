# EVChargingStationModel
 Optimisation model for determining optimal location of electric vehicle charging stations as to maximise electric vehicle adoption


In order to run any of the solving methods, you must first instantiate the data using the appropriate data file and class. Due to size limitations, the data files used for testing are not contained in this repository. However, they are available upon request. We also note that the heuristic methods use the data class from the Maximum Covering model, and so data should be instantiated using the Data_MaximumCover class found in MaximumCover_Data.py.

Network information, as well as ressources to create user class and station files, can be found within the Data folder.
